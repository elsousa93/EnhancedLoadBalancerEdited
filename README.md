# Description

This bundle contains Enhanced Load Balanced Participant plugin. This plugin is used in a process in "Map Participants to Users" tab. 

If you need an automatic user task assignment in a subsequent activity in a process, add this plugin to your participant map to perform the automatic assignment. 

The participant plugin will assign tasks to the user (within user defined parameters) with the least number of total pending assignments. If there are two or more candidates, the first user (sorted alphabetically by username) will be assigned.

The plugin will evaluate and assign the user the task based on the following parameters:

Within an organization
Within a department
Within a group
Within this app or globally
Exclude current logged in user
Ignore users task count in selected activities
